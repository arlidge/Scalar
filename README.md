Using p5js to make some art. 

Try using the arrow keys on your keyboard to experiment.

Programmed keys: control, up, down, left, mouse click

"s" will save what you have made

This should just work as is, becasue it is using cdnjs.com to get the p5 libraries.

To return to the starting colours just press any non programmed key. 

Massive shout out to Daniel Shiffman. Without his efforts I would have given up before I started.
